# In knights.py
def shrubbery():
	print "I am a shrubber"

def ni():
	print "Ni! " * 3

# Run a Python shell in the same directory as knights.py and enter the following
# import class3_knights
# knights.shrubbery()
# knights.ni()

# or
# from class3_knights import shrubbery, ni
# shrubbery()
# ni()

# ^ this one is easier in the long run
